# Programming Concepts

There are some basic `programming concepts`, once you know some of them you will
find ways to combine them and build bigger programs. In this book we don't use
concepts of so-called `Object Oriented Programming` (short: `OOP`). 

So which concepts do we use? 

+ Variables, assignment, types.
+ Conversions between types.
+ Calculations/Operations and String manipulation.
+ Conditional statements (`if`-constructions).
+ Loops (`while` / `for`).
+ Collections (`Array` and `List`).
